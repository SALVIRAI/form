For the first page, salvi.html where form data has to be filled.

For moving onto next page, detail.html has been used.

The task work as follows:

1.Firstly the client need to generate his/her unique Id.
2.And afterwards the given fields need to be filled.
3.Custom Validation is done by using pattern syntax  anyone can change its condition.

Thanks and regards
